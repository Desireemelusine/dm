## My Portfolio - Introduction

After I got my graduation on my Nanodegree as a Front-End Developer I decided to challenge myself with a new project. Build my portfolio based on a Bootstrap Template that already exists and change completely to my needs.

In a way gave me the feeling of refactoring the code, cleaning what wasn't need, add javaScript, work on CSS and create new items. I had to do a lot of research on things that I didn't know and learn before making any changing. I loved the challenge and it gave me the confidence to know that I'm capable to read tons of code and understand the importance of each line of code and make the decision to change or not.

### What I've Done

I bought the template from  https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/vitality-one-page-bootstrap-4-theme-WB02K3KK3

The first step was:
* I knew Bootstrap 3 so I took time to understand Bootstrap 4 before start
* Took some time to understand vitality.js and JS/ files
* I planned the project on paper, including images, links, buttons etc.

The second step was | Mobile First :
* The project was built first for mobile
* Cleaning code for HTML - I decided to put all the information on Js/Main.js for an easy update on the information without the need to open the HTML.
* New file  Js/Main.js - for data (KnockoutJS) and javaScript function - toggle
* I made some changes on the Js/vitality.js for the benefit of the Portfolio** and based on the needs
* Reorganization and clean code for CSS/style.css, also some new lines
* @ mediaquery - I had careful attention on this matter to be sure it would follow the resolution and devices.

The original presentation did not allow to add the link, either open it because it had an animation that blocked the access to the link.

 Thanks!
